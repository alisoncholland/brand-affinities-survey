This script contains code to create bar and radar graphs to visualise and compare different brands and emotional ties around those brands. 
Data is from a quantitative survey where all questions were closed ended.

Installation
I used the free statistical software programme R (https://www.r-project.org/) to write and analyse my data. Once R is up and running, install and load the CRAN packages listed in the code.
Usage
Feel free to use whatever code you like. All I kindly ask in return is that you cite it appropriately :)
